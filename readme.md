Created for the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University course 'Developing Data Products'.

This project is a Shiny app that visualizes data from the 'SumHes.csv' file.

The 'SumHes.csv' data includes economic variables (e.g., population, GDP, saving rate) of countries from 1960 to 1985.  It was downloaded from:
https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/SumHes.csv
at
https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

The application lets you look up a country's gross domestic product (GDP), population, or saving rate from 1960 - 1985. It graphs these variables so that you can see how the country during that year compared to other countries in that year or to other years.
